# image compression with fast fourier transform

Course assignment for CS 371: implementation of an image compression model using fast fourier transform

The code uses matrices for the 3 primary colours and applies FFT, effectively compressing the image when the inverse transform is applied.

Examples at compression rates 50%, 80% and 95%.
